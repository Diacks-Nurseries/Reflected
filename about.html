          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p1>Welcome to Reflected, the band that brings a unique blend of music to your ears. Founded in 2021, our journey began under the name "The Bad Bandits," with Kian on bass, Noah on drums, Adrian on bass, and Christian on vocals. With no specific inspiration, we embarked on this musical adventure simply out of a love for playing instruments and creating music.

            In 2023, we were fortunate to have Krue Spencer join our team as the brains of the operation, the tech manager, overall manager, and designer. Krue's addition brought a fresh perspective and expertise to the team, helping us improve and streamline our organization. With their skills in technology management, overall management, and design, Krue played a crucial role in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our processes.
            
            As time went on, our band evolved, and today, Reflected comprises Kian on bass guitar, William Banes on rhythm guitar, Lucas Dawson on lead guitar, and Noah on drums. Kian also showcases his talent on the harmonica. Together, we form the heart of the band, working hard to bring our music to life.
            
            But our band wouldn't be complete without the dedicated individuals who support us behind the scenes. We have a team of talented designers who contribute their ideas for album covers, as well as a tech manager, Krue Spencer, who handles our online presence. They are the driving force that helps us connect with our fans and promote our music through various channels.
            
            While we currently don't require additional members, the future is always full of possibilities. Maybe someday, we'll find the perfect vocalist to join our ranks. Who knows what lies ahead for us?
            
            Reflecting our growth and aspirations, we have considered a name change to "The Silver Kiwis." This name holds a special meaning as it represents our roots in New Zealand, where we come together to create beautiful music that shines brightly.
            
            We have a strong presence across multiple social media platforms, including YouTube, Spotify, Instagram, and Facebook. Among these, YouTube has given us the most significant following, allowing us to share a diverse range of content, from full-length videos to shorts. On Instagram, we're steadily approaching the milestone of 1,000 followers, and our Spotify presence is also growing steadily.
            
            As for our roles within the band, Kian takes on the responsibility of playing the bass guitar and acts as the band's founder, having invited the other members to join. We believe in working together as a team, and each of us plays a vital role in contributing to the band's sound and success.
            
            Looking ahead, we envision various paths for our future. While we can't predict fame, we are determined to pursue music professionally. Our goal is to share our passion with a broader audience, make a lasting impact with our music, and continue to grow as musicians.
            
            Currently, we are not generating significant financial returns from our music. However, through platforms like United Masters, we earn a modest income of around $1.30 per month. We understand that the journey to financial success requires dedication and hard work, and we remain committed to our musical endeavors.
            
            When it comes to competition, we don't see ourselves as competitors with other musicians or bands. Instead, we focus on creating unique music and connecting with our audience in an authentic way. Our journey is about self-expression and connecting with people who resonate with our music.
            
            Throughout our journey, we've had our fair share of funny fan encounters. From being chased by enthusiastic fans at school to earning nicknames like "Paul McCartney," we've enjoyed the support and recognition within our community. It's a joy to see our music bring happiness to others.
